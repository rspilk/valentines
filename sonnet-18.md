```
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate. 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
And summer's lease hath all too short a date. 
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
And often is his gold complexion dimmed; 
And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed; 
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
```
